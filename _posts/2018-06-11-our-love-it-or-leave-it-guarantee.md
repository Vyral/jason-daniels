How do we ensure our buyers are happy with their home purchase? We offer a “Love It or Leave It” guarantee and here is how it works.

Today I want to talk a little about our love it or leave it guarantee. We want to make sure that when you buy a home with us, you are completely happy and comfortable with it.

Because of this, we guarantee that you will love your home. If you decide at any time in the first two years that you made a bad decision, we will sell your home for free. There will still be a commission due to the agent who brings in a buyer, but you will not pay us a dime on commission and we will help you find a home that does fit your needs in the meantime.

This is a great program that helps our buyers feel at ease. This is a big purchase, and we want you to have the security of knowing that we will take care of you either way.

If you have any questions about this program or anything else related to real estate, feel free to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
