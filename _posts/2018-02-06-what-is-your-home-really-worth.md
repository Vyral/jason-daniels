Today I’m excited to talk about home values. Want to know what your home is really worth? Here’s how to find out without paying for an expensive appraisal.

There are many different websites out there that offer an instant value of your house, but many of them are simply not accurate. Many of them are based on algorithms that are based on the tax assessor’s value. If that value isn’t correct, the predictions are not going to be very accurate.

If you visit www.coloradohomesvalue.com you’ll get an instant value that takes more information into account than your average valuation. In addition to that, we will follow up in a few days with a more specific, customized home value estimate.

We have all the same information appraisers do, just not the title. We aren’t licensed appraisers, but we can tell you with certainty where your homes will sell for in the current market based on our knowledge and experience (over 900 homes sold).

If you have any questions for us or need any help determining an accurate value for your home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
