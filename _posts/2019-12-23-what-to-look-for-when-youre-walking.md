When you’re walking through a home you’re considering for purchase, what things should you keep an eye out for? Today I’ll tell you.

When you’re touring a resale listing you’re interested in purchasing, look at the windows, doors, ceilings, and other areas of the home for signs of structural damage. Check to see if there’s any cracked drywall, water damage, rust on the water heater, or drainage coming from the air conditioning.

Pay attention to the plumbing, too, especially if you live in Colorado Springs: Polybutylene pipes used in house construction in the 1980s have been known to burst.

You’ll also want to take a walk around outside the home to check for cracks in the brick, siding, or foundation walls. See if your roof is made with t-lock shingles, as the whole roof will need replacing if any of them are damaged.

Above all, make sure that you’re working with a knowledgeable Realtor. You don’t want to take the time to write an offer on a home that has a host of hidden, potentially costly issues that will cause problems down the road.

I have a background in construction management, and my team has been trained to know just what to look for. We’ll also help you schedule a home inspection for a home you’re interested in purchasing; a home inspector will go through the whole house to assess the condition of the property.

Again, don’t get caught up in the aesthetics of the house. Ugly carpets can be replaced, and shiny new appliances don’t necessarily mean the whole house is that new or stable.

If you have any questions about buying a home, including what to look for as you walk through a showing, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you ensure that your next purchase goes off without a hitch.
