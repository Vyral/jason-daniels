<br>Can you trust Zillow’s Zestimates?

**The short answer is no—whether you’re buying or selling, they should only be used as a starting point**. Roughly 75% of the Zestimates in Colorado are inaccurate. Even Zillow themselves states that their Zestimates are off by an average of 5%, and we’ve found that that average is usually closer to 10% That means if the average sale price in your area is $400,000, the Zestimate for any home could be off by as much as $43,000.

You see, Zillow relies on public and user-submitted data to calculate their Zestimates, which means that anyone can artificially inflate their home’s value on Zillow’s website. Think of it this way: If you weren’t feeling well and went to WebMD to give yourself a diagnosis, that might work if you have something as simple as a cold. If you have a serious health concern, though, you’ll probably reach out to a doctor.

That’s why, **if you really want to know what your home is worth, you’re better off reaching out to a real estate agent**. Here at Finch & Gable, we’d be happy to meet with you, go over the numbers, and give you a free, accurate valuation of your home.
