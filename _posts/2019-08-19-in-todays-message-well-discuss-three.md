In today’s message, we’ll discuss three reasons why buyers’ offers are rejected and what you should do if this happens to you.

Want to Buy a Home? Search All Homes
Want to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value Report

Your offer on the home your sights are set on has been rejected. What should you do now?


Before you do anything, seek your real estate professional’s advice on why they think the seller turned your offer down. A lot of times, if you’ve made an offer well below asking price and the home hasn’t been on the market for long, therein lies the problem. With the help of your Realtor, pull a list of comparable sales from that neighborhood to make sure your offer was reasonable.    

If you’re puzzled because you made what you believed to be a strong offer, it could be that the seller received multiple offers and chose one with a more favorable price and/or terms. Next time, see if multiple offers have been made on the home, so you can give yours some added appeal.

It’s also possible that the seller is being difficult, and their rejection is a sign that they want you to come up in price. It’s often tough to identify the reason unless you and your Realtor dig a little deeper.  


If you have any questions or you’ve been rejected by a seller before and you’re no longer working with an agent, please reach out to my team. Our mission is to help you get the best deal in the least amount of time and with the least amount of hassle.


And if you have any other real estate-related questions, let us know as well. We look forward to serving your needs!
