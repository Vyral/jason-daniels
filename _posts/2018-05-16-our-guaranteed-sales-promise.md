Today I’d like to talk to you about our seller guarantee.

We are so sure that we can get your home sold that we guarantee to sell your home in 29 days—if we don’t, we’ll sell it for free.

That’s right! We won’t take a commission if we don’t meet that mark. We believe that we should be able to sell your home in that time frame based on our marketing plan and the conditions of the market. There will still be a fee to the agent who brought the buyer, as well as a processing fee, but you will still save thousands if we don’t get the job done.

If you’d like more information about our seller’s guarantee, please give us a call or send an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
