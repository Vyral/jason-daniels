Did you know our team offers an unconditional cancellation guarantee for our buyers and sellers? This guarantee essentially means that if you are unhappy with our services, you can cancel at any time, free of charge. All we ask is that you give us written notice, and allow us 24 business hours to attempt to correct the issue. If you still are unsatisfied after this period of time, we will cancel our agreement. Most agents require their clients to sign a long-term commitment, but our team is different. Your satisfaction is our goal, so the last thing we want is to force you into an arrangement doesn’t meet your standards. To see our full message, watch this short video.
