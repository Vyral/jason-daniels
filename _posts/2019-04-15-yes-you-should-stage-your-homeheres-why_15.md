As a home seller, you should know that staging your home can help it sell quicker and for more money. In fact, NAR statistics show that staged homes sell for 17% more on average. Other studies show that staged homes sell twice as quickly as well.

That being said, there are two ways a home can be staged: One is by leaving it vacant with no furniture, and the other is by having a professional stager declutter and arrange the furniture. If you list your home with our team, depending on which marketing package you use, we have a certified, professional home stager stage your home room by room.

We also have a list of staging tips we give all our seller clients during our first meeting. If you’d like a copy of this list, get in touch with us and we’d be happy to send you one. You don’t have to follow your home stager’s advice, but the statistics don’t lie—it really does make a difference.

If your home is vacant and it’s at or above the $400,000 to $450,000 price range, we recommend that you at least stage the kitchen, living room, and master bedroom. These are the key areas people will try to imagine where their furniture will fit, so having furniture in there will help them do this.

If you’d like to know more about staging a vacant home or how to stage a home with existing furniture, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you.
