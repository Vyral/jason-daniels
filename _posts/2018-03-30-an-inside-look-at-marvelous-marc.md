Today I’m excited to be joined by special guest Marc Feickert, owner of Marvelous Marc Balloons, to talk about his business.

Marc has been in Colorado Springs for just over five years after starting his business in Utah almost a decade ago. It all began at a birthday party he was attending. Someone was attempting to fill up balloons but was struggling to do so.

When Marc made a suggestion about his technique, the person just decided to put Marc in charge instead. It was at that party when Marc learned about turning these balloons into shapes. All of a sudden, he was changing balloons into cats, dogs, cars, and more.

Marc is someone we’ve used at our own client events for years, and our team can tell you first-hand that he is a truly remarkable artist.

In the spring, Marc often works at school dances, graduations, and other events. “Balloons aren’t just for kids,” Marc says.

Of course, Marc’s talent has caught a lot of local attention, meaning he’s always booked out far in advance. If you want to reach out to Marc and book an event, you can reach out to him by phone at (719) 749-6224 or by visiting www.marvelousmarcballoons.com.

If you’re a business owner like Marc and would like to be featured in a future segment, join us at our next event. We host these events on the second Thursday of each month from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at varying venues, so keep an eye on your inbox and Facebook for invitations.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
