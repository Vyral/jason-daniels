Here’s why your home hasn’t sold and what you can do about it.

Why won’t your home sell? The answer boils down to one or a combination of three reasons:


1. Price—your home might be priced too high
2. Condition—it might not be in the appropriate condition for how it’s priced
3. Location—it may be in a less popular area


If your home’s condition and location aren’t ideal, these factors can still be overcome if it’s priced properly. Anyone will buy anything if it’s priced correctly.

If you don’t want to drop your sale price, you can always try improving your home’s condition. A new coat of paint and a fresh layer of carpet are easy upgrades you can make. You can’t do much to “improve” your location, so just keep in mind that most homebuyers will be concerned about homes that, for example, back up to a busy street.

If you’d like my team and me to diagnose your situation, we would be happy to come out to your home, offer some tips about what needs to be done to it, and determine whether it’s priced appropriately for our market. Just give us a call or send us an email—we look forward to hearing from you.
