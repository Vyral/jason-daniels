<center><em>By using our Green Photo Initiative, our winter home sellers will stand out amid the competition.</em></center>

<br><br>If you’re thinking of listing your home this coming winter, our Green Photo Initiative will help it sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

With this initiative, **we’ll send a professional photographer to your house to take pictures of its exterior and capture its beauty while your lawn is still green and landscaping still in bloom.** We’ll then hold onto these photos for you until you find your next home and are ready to list. You need a professional photographer who knows how to make people want your home, and we know several such photographers we can send your way.&nbsp;

Last year, we were able to help many sellers maximize their exposure by using this strategy. When your home goes on the market in November, December, January, or February, it will stand out among the other listings that have drab, dreary winter pictures.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to sign up for this initiative, just call or email the Finch and Gable Real Estate Company anytime.** If you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;
