Updating your home, either for your own enjoyment or to prepare it for the market, can be achieved through a few strategic projects.

Whether youâ€™re preparing to list or simply want to keep your property up to date, there are a number of home improvement projects I recommend.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1. Make kitchen updates.** Solid-surface countertops, stainless steel appliances, and white cabinets are all great choices that never go out of style. Including these features in your own kitchen can really make the room shine.
**2. Make bathroom updates.** Solid-surface countertops are also popular in bathrooms. One popular bathroom update in higher-end homes is the inclusion of heated floors.
**3. Update the flooring.** Carpet is still popular in bedrooms and family rooms, but hardwood flooring is the way to go in kitchens, dining rooms, hallways, and more.
**4. Update the lighting and plumbing fixtures.** Brass is no longer a sought-after finish for these home features. Instead, opt for brushed nickel or oil-rubbed bronze.
**5. Add fresh paint.** Light, neutral colors such as beige are a good go-to choice these days. Greys are also very popular. Sometimes the simplest changes make the greatest impact.
**6. Pay attention to current trends.** Open floor plans are something many buyers look for in a home. Also, outdoor living areas have become more highly sought-after. Formal dining rooms, on the other hand, seem to be falling out of favor.
If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can help you meet your real estate goals, feel free to give my team and me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
