<center><em>Here’s some helpful advice for sellers in this hot, fast-paced market.</em></center>

<br>Lately, we’ve had a lot of clients ask us about the different options they have in this market and there are a few misconceptions we want to clear up:

**1. Don’t sell as is.** With some basic paint, carpet, and flooring, you can double, triple, or even quadruple your investment if the home is marketed properly.

**2. Don’t overprice.** We see homes in this market that are overpriced all the time. They end up sitting on the market for a lot longer than the rest. Price it at or slightly below market value and that’s where you’ll get top dollar.

**3. Don’t use a discount broker or FSBO.** If you use a discount broker, you might expect a discount price for your home. FSBO can be really challenging for someone with no experience, and you’re likely to get taken advantage of by seasoned agents and investors. 

In this market, we’re getting our sellers more money than ever before by following these steps. If you have any questions about selling in the market or real estate in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
