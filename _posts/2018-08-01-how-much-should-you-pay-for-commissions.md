Today I want to talk about commission rates. Do you know how much to pay?

How much do you pay your real estate agent to sell your home? The truth may surprise you.

I want to start by saying that commission fees are negotiable. There is no standard, set rate. If any agent is trying to tell you that there is a fixed rate, this is untrue. Every agent can charge whatever they choose.

However, there is a traditional norm of 6%. This amount is usually split between the buyer's agent and the selling agent.

While commissions are not fixed, you do get what you pay for. A recently licensed real estate agent will come out and probably charge 6%, but are they going to have a marketing plan and budget?

To learn more about choosing the right agent, you can watch my other video here. In the meantime, you need to make sure that you pick the right agent that is going to have a budget to work with. If they are charging the standard rate, what are you getting for it?

My team and I have a flexible fee structure where you choose the commission that you want to pay. Just remember, you get what you pay for. A friend of mine once said, “What is cheap isn't good and what is good isn't cheap.”

If you have any specific questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
