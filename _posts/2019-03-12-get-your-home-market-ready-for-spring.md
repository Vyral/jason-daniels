Spring is one of the best times of year to sell your home, but what can you do to ensure your sale is as successful as possible?

To fully maximize your listing’s potential, there are a few key preparations you must make before putting your property on the market.

First, spruce up your curb appeal. You only get one chance to make a first impression, so make it count. Keep your lawn trimmed, have your bushes and trees looking neat, and add strategic pops of color by putting potted flowers along your walkway or near your door. You’d be amazed what a difference a little fresh mulch can make.

The next step you should take is to clean and declutter. Not only will this make your home look better but, it will also help you get a jumpstart on the packing process.

If you don’t have time to clean yourself, or if you just want to make sure the job is done correctly, you can always hire a professional.

After this, you should touch up your flooring and walls if necessary. Dings and scratches in your drywall should be patched, and fresh paint should be applied as necessary. Make sure to stick to neutral colors, though, as this will appeal to the widest range of buyers.

And speaking of appealing to buyers, make sure you put away any pet-related items. Though we all love our own four-legged family members, not all buyers do. That huge cat tree you have in your living room could be a major turnoff for potential buyers, so it’s best to put such items away.

Of course, every home is different. If you have any questions about how to prepare your home, specifically, we’d be happy to come visit for a free consultation. Then, if you decide to continue working with us, our team’s home stager will take your property to the next level.

If you’d like more information or would like guidance on any other aspect of the real estate process, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
