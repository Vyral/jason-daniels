<p>Why should you hire a real estate agent to help you purchase a home? I have five reasons to share with you today.</p>

Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for sale</p>

<p>If you think you don’t need an agent to buy a home, think again. Here’s what a real estate agent actually does to help you throughout the home buying process:</p>

<p><strong>1. An agent will help you determine what your needs and wants are</strong> before you even start looking at homes, which is very important in this fast-moving market.</p>

<p><strong>2. The agent will help obtain financing and a pre-approval</strong> from a good local lender that can get you to the closing table.</p>

<p><strong>3. Your agent will help you navigate through all the paperwork and regulations.</strong> In Colorado, the contract is over 16 pages long. That does not include the additional 15 to 20 pages of required disclosures.</p>

<p><strong>4. An agent will negotiate on your behalf and in your best interests.</strong> If you don’t work with a Realtor, there is no neutral third party to help you through the process. You will be emotionally tied to the property, and the other agent and the seller will be able to read that. As a result, you won’t have any leverage during negotiations.</p>

<p><strong>5. Your agent can provide valuable information about the neighborhood and the area.</strong> They will let you know about abandoned underground mines, areas with bad soil, and other details that local agents know that you may not, especially if you are from out of town.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE WILL COORDINATE EVERYTHING IN THE TRANSACTION FOR YOU, FROM A TO Z.%20http://localhost:4000/why-hire-realtor-when-buying-home.html%20via%40" target="_blank" class="pullquote">“WE WILL COORDINATE EVERYTHING IN THE TRANSACTION FOR YOU, FROM A TO Z.”</a></p>

<p>Overall, your real estate agent has valuable experience that can help you throughout the entire transaction. Finding a home that you like is just one piece of the pie. Getting the house under contract, negotiating the best deal, and then getting through the inspection and the appraisal to the closing table takes a lot of work.</p>

<p>As your real estate agent, we will coordinate everything for you from A to Z. Let us do the work for you. You won’t have to pay us a dime, either—the seller usually pays the buyer’s agent’s commission.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions about buying a home, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!</p>

I'll say that Jason and his team are exceptional, and I don't use that word lightly because I've sold two houses with Jason and there's a reason I came back to working with him. Not only did our house sell fast, it sold for the right price, we never had to reduce price, we never had to go up in price. I'd sold houses with other Realtors before so I had an idea of what was supposed to happen but what I was really impressed with, with Jason is that his negotiating skills are excellent and I'd never had any Realtor that I'd worked with before, I'm military, I've moved many times, bought and sold several houses, and no one has ever really taken the initiative to negotiate for things I didn't ask for. I really felt like I walked out with the best deal I possibly could have had. Jason Daniels, you definitely want him on your team!</p>

I’ve probably done like 25, 30 buys and sells with him, so I’m probably at about 50 to 60 somewhere. There’s been a few houses where he always seems to be able to get me an extra few thousand dollars when an offer will come in that’s lower than what I’m asking. He has a really good feel on if the buyer will come up a little bit more of if they’re at their max or if they’re really wanting the house. Or he’d be able to say, “Hey these people are really excited about this house, I get that from their agent and if you want to counter, they’ll probably come up some on their price.</p>

The next day, we saw three houses that were exactly what we were looking for, and we bought one. Later on, he sold that house for us. A few days after he put the sign up, a verbal offer came in. Jason told us he would try to bring the buyer up to full price. When the written offer came in, we got the asking price! I believe he worked very hard for that.
