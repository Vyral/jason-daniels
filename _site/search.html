Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportHow exactly do property taxes affect your monthly mortgage payment? Most lenders require that they pay your taxes by placing some of your closing cost money in an escrow account. This ensures that the government won’t place a lien on the property before the mortgage company does.“Once the lender calculates your tax bill, they divide it by 12 and add it to your monthly payment”Via an estimate from the county, your lender will figure out what your tax estimate is. Taxes are due April 15, but here in Colorado, property taxes are paid in arrears, meaning that your taxes don’t have to be paid in their entirety by April 15. Specifically, the state allows you to pay the first half of what you owe in taxes in February, and the second half in June.Many mortgage companies prefer this method because it allows them to hold on to your money and keep the interest. Once the lender calculates your tax bill, they divide it by 12 and add it to your monthly payment, splitting it up nicely over the year.If you’re using an online mortgage calculator, make sure you’re including taxes and homeowner’s insurance because those will most certainly affect your monthly payment.If you have more questions about this topic, or you’re ready to start looking at homes, feel free to reach out to me via phone or email.

Get a Home Value ReportToday I want to explain the three main reasons why real estate deals fall apart. Some of these deal-breakers are avoidable, some are not.1. Financing. If the buyer is having financial difficulties, like not getting the proper documentation to the lender or having issues with income, a deal can fall apart. There are many reasons financing can fall through.“Some of these deal-breakers are avoidable, some are not.”2. Problem with the property. If a problem with the property is found during the inspection, like a major issue with the roof or furnace that the seller is not willing to address, that can often lead to the deal falling apart. However, if you’re the seller, you have to disclose that information to the next buyer, so it always makes sense to keep the first deal together. As a buyer, if there are multiple offers on the home, you need to decide if it makes sense to cancel the deal if it’s not going to cost you that much to fix it yourself. Your Realtor can help with this decision.3. Cold feet. Sometimes a buyer gets cold feet and backs out of the deal, or sometimes they find a house they like better.If you have any questions please reach out by phone or email.

        "content": "If you’re confused about what an escrow account is, today I’ll provide a quick definition.Want to Buy a Home? Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportWhat is an escrow account?An escrow account is what a mortgage company sets up when buyers get a loan to purchase a house. The account is comprised of funds that don’t apply to the principal or interest of your mortgage. In other words, they’ll go toward your property taxes and homeowners insurance. The payment for setting up your escrow account is included in the closing costs.Every time you make a monthly payment to your mortgage company, they’ll take a piece of that check and put it into your escrow account. Usually, homeowners insurance is billed annually, so your mortgage company will use your escrow account to pay your bill when it’s due. That’s why your insurance company actually sends your mortgage company the bill.“Every time you make a monthly payment to your mortgage company, they’ll take a piece of that check and put it into your escrow account.”Here in Colorado, property taxes are paid in arrears, which means you can pay them in April, or pay half in February and half in June. Most mortgage companies prefer to split the payment. That way, after they make the first payment in February, they can collect interest on it until June.When it’s time to sell your home, a lot of sellers have one question in particular at the closing table: Why is the title company billing me for taxes if I already paid them through my mortgage company? When you pay taxes to your mortgage company, those funds aren’t sent to the county—they’re held in your account. When you sell your home, to ensure there are no tax judgments against the new owner, the title company has to collect them from you at closing. You can either pay out of your equity or write them a check.The mortgage company will then mail you a check three or four weeks after closing, so make sure they have your new forwarding address so you can get that money back.As always, if you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportWhen you’re touring a resale listing you’re interested in purchasing, look at the windows, doors, ceilings, and other areas of the home for signs of structural damage. Check to see if there’s any cracked drywall, water damage, rust on the water heater, or drainage coming from the air conditioning.Pay attention to the plumbing, too, especially if you live in Colorado Springs: Polybutylene pipes used in house construction in the 1980s have been known to burst.You’ll also want to take a walk around outside the home to check for cracks in the brick, siding, or foundation walls. See if your roof is made with t-lock shingles, as the whole roof will need replacing if any of them are damaged.“Don’t get caught up in the aesthetics of the house.”Above all, make sure that you’re working with a knowledgeable Realtor. You don’t want to take the time to write an offer on a home that has a host of hidden, potentially costly issues that will cause problems down the road.I have a background in construction management, and my team has been trained to know just what to look for. We’ll also help you schedule a home inspection for a home you’re interested in purchasing; a home inspector will go through the whole house to assess the condition of the property.Again, don’t get caught up in the aesthetics of the house. Ugly carpets can be replaced, and shiny new appliances don’t necessarily mean the whole house is that new or stable.If you have any questions about buying a home, including what to look for as you walk through a showing, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "When should you lower the price of your for-sale home? Here’s my advice.Want to Buy a Home? Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportWhen we work with our seller clients, we track how many online visits their listing gets via Zillow, Realtor.com, and so on. We expect a certain amount of traffic based on the home itself, but if the listing doesn’t get as much as we’d expected, we’ll take a look at other listings in the area we’re marketing the home in to find out whether it’s just our seller’s home or if it’s the market in general.Sometimes homes fail to attract attention simply because the market has begun to slow down, and in those cases, you don’t want to lower your price.We’ll also monitor the physical activity your listing generates—that is, how many people are actually coming to your home for a showing. If your home is receiving a lot of online traffic but few or no in-person showings, then the price of your home needs to be reduced.When it is necessary to change your home’s price, you’ll often have to change it by at least $5,000 to even see a difference in the flow of traffic around your home, and sometimes by $10,000 to trigger any offers.The market is always going up and down and correcting itself, but right now, home sellers need to be careful to price their homes more realistically from the very beginning.“If your home is receiving a lot of online traffic but few or no in-person showings, then the price of your home needs to be reduced.”You do have some options, however. Suppose you’ve listed your home for $300,000 and you get an offer from a buyer that requests a $20,000 reduction. Scott Edgin, a friend of mine from Universal Lending Services, shared a tip with my team: If the buyer makes an offer below your asking price, you can buy the interest rate down for the buyer for up to a full point. For the $300,000 home, that would amount to $10,000.If the buyer were to have gotten the home for the $280,000 they had originally requested, their monthly payment would still be higher than if they’d paid the asking price and asked you to buy down their interest rate—about $70 higher per month.We’ve found this to be a creative way for sellers to still get their asking price for their home and to give buyers a lower monthly payment. It’s truly a win-win situation.If you have any questions about this approach, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.",

It seems that even people in the industry get these terms mixed up, but they have very distinct differences.A pre-qualification is when a buyer reaches out to a lender and verbally told them about their income and debts in a short application. This is a great first step, but the pre-approval takes things to another level.“Being pre-approved is much more advantageous to buyers”A pre-approval is when the lender submits an application and verifies the debts, income, and assets of the potential buyer. We like to see our clients get pre-approved before shopping for a home.

Get a Home Value ReportHow much will you pay in closing costs?What you’ll pay is determined by whether the buyer and the seller both have closing costs. The seller is generally going to have closing costs. Here in Colorado, it’s customary for the seller to pay for the title insurance. The closing fee for the title company and the closer that does all the paperwork is commonly split evenly between the buyer and seller, it’s usually around $130 each. The title work can be anywhere from 0.5% to 0.75% of the sales price. That’s frequently a seller cost.“What you’ll pay is determined by whether the buyer and the seller both have closing costs.”Closing costs will typically be more expensive for the buyer, especially if they’re using a loan. If you’re paying cash, your closing costs are minimal. I recommend you work with a local lender that can educate you on loan programs, if you’re going that route, to determine what you’ll pay in your specific closing costs. The great news is, some of those loan deals offer cash assistance programs from local government agencies or the state. Depending on the market, we can also ask the seller to pay for some of the buyer’s closing costs.If you have any questions please speak with your Realtor.

Get a Home Value ReportIf you’ve ever wondered what happens during the home inspection process, today’s message is for you.During an inspection, a NACHI-certified home inspector will visit the property and check out everything from the major systems and appliances to the most minor of details. So, given how thorough this process is, you can imagine that the reports they produce at the end of the inspection are bound to reflect some problems.“Safety, mechanical, structural, or health-related problems tend to be the most significant.”The most important thing is to know which problems are a big deal and which aren’t. Safety, mechanical, structural, or health-related problems tend to be the most significant. So, if you’re buying a home that has any of these issues, you and your Realtor will almost certainly draft an objection to ask that the seller either resolve the problems themselves or give you a financial credit to do so.After receiving this, the seller will respond with an amendment to the purchase contract called an inspection resolution.

If you’re considering turning your own home into an Airbnb, you have a great opportunity to do so, but there are a few things to keep in mind.First, Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs have implemented several restrictions regarding short-term rentals.

What should you do now?Before you do anything, seek your real estate professional’s advice on why they think the seller turned your offer down.

Search All HomesWant to Sell a Home? Get a Home Value ReportAre you ready to buy a fixer-upper?To answer this question, you need to understand what you’re getting into, because unless you’re just repainting and replacing the carpet, this kind of project takes a long time. That’s why, before you begin the process, you should talk with your Realtor so you both know what you’re getting into.Shopping for fixer-upper is sort of like shopping for another home, but with a few key differences. The homes you look at should have enough equity in them so that you can spend money on them without over-improving them. Also, anytime you buy a fixer-uppers, whether you plan on staying in the home or not, you need to make sure you’ll be able to get your money back when you sell it. You make your money when you purchase the fixer-upper, so keep an eye out for estate sales, foreclosures, or listings that were once rentals and are now a little rough around the edges.Before you buy anything, though, you need to do your due diligence, and it’s a good idea to talk to a contractor during this time. There’s a lot of research involved in this process, and you need to be able to estimate the repair costs of each house and price out the materials (flooring, paint, etc.) needed for those repairs.“Shopping for fixer-upper is sort of like shopping for another home, but with a few key differences.”I’ve seen home renovation projects nearly ruin marriages, so make sure you have the necessary time to devote to this type of project. If you’re a working professional, you probably won’t have time to fix up the property all by yourself, so you should consider hiring a contractor to do the work.If you’re able to do the work yourself, you can build up a lot of sweat equity, but you need to know your skill level before you dive into it. Sometimes people get in over their heads and end up stuck with a neverending rehab project. Either that, or they’re forced to sell at a loss.When it comes to financing your purchase, there are some great loan options available out there. The FHA 203(k) and FHA 203(k) streamline loans, for example, will finance the purchase of the property and the work involved to fix it up. There are also various conventional loan products that do the same thing.I have a background in construction management and have flipped many homes myself, so if you have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Search all homes for sale“How do I buy and sell a home at the same time?”This is a quandary a lot of our clients get really stressed about. However, we’ve walked hundreds of clients through this process, and so today I’ll give you some guidance on how to navigate this type of transaction.Many people can’t afford to buy the next home until they sell their current one because all of their equity is tied up in it. This is a barrier, but not an insurmountable one. There are a couple of different ways to approach this scenario:1. Sell first, then place a contingent offer. Typically, this is the easiest option: First, we list your home and get it under contract, then we go shopping for another home. Once you’ve located the home you want to buy, we’ll write a contingent offer on it, which means that your offer to purchase the home is contingent on the sale of your current one. That way, you won’t have to worry about losing your earnest money on the new home, especially if the deal falls apart.Back when the market was getting tight, many sellers didn’t want to accept contingent offers. If there are multiple offers up for grabs, they’d typically choose a non-contingent offer. Today’s market, however, is more of a level playing field—if you’re willing to make a decent offer, sellers are willing to accept a contingent offer, so long as your current home is already under contract.This option also enables you to move only once between homes. You won’t have to put your belongings into storage as you wait to purchase a home to move into.“We’ll take a look at your individual situation and assess what options will work best for you.”2. Pull equity from your current home to buy the second home.  If you have the ability to tap into the equity of your current home, you can actually apply for a line of credit, also known as a bridge loan, that will let you use the equity from your current home to serve as a down payment on your new home. Of course, you’d have to qualify for both mortgages, which can be a little risky, but you can contact us if you have any questions about that.The great thing about this method is that if you have lots of children and/or pets, you can move into your new home without having to worry about scheduling showings for your old home while you still live there.When you’re our client, we’ll take a look at your individual situation and assess what options will work best for you.

They’d really like to move in the wintertime, but they’ve heard rumors that the market is just better in the spring and summer and that you’ll get more money.That can be true in some cases, but not always. When asked this question, we always tell our clients that they should sell the home when it’s right for them given their unique situation, whenever that may be. If you try to time the market, you may get burned, or it may cause stress in other areas of your life—it’s never totally a safe bet.Contrary to popular belief, we sell a lot of homes in the months of November, December, and January, and people are still buying them. In fact, I knew a broker years ago who did a six-year study; I’ve run the numbers again recently, and the stats still hold true.We looked at the number of home sales that occurred in the months of June, July, and August, and then compared them to homes that sold in November, December, and January. This is what we found: Only 9% of the homes active on the market were actually selling in the summer months, whereas in the winter months, 14% of the homes on the market sold. That means that 5% more homes sold in the winter than in the summer.“Contrary to popular belief, we sell a lot of homes in the months of November, December, and January.”There are a couple of reasons for that trend. Many homes are put on the market in the summer to test the market out, and there are a lot more buyers during that time. So do more homes sell during the spring and summer? Yes, but your odds are better if you sell in the winter.Some people want to take the holidays off so they don’t have to deal with people walking through their home, and that’s okay. If you need to sell your home, we’ll get it done whenever is best for you. However, if you do want to list in the spring, it’ll be better if you start now so you can begin preparing and staging your home before the frenzy begins.If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Search all homes for saleThinking about everything that goes into buying a home may seem overwhelming, but don’t worry—our team is here to help. We’ve broken down the home buying process into nine simple steps:1. Find a Realtor you can trust. Don’t hire the first Realtor you see on a yard sign. Instead, do your research on local agents and choose a professional who has the experience, knowledge, and resources necessary to guide your home buying experience.2. Get pre-approved with a local lender. Doing this will not only help you better understand what you can afford, but it will also help you determine what kind of financing is best for your circumstances. Even if you’re paying with cash, you’ll still need to connect with a lender to request a proof-of-funds letter.3. Have a consultation with your agent. Before beginning your search as a buyer, sit down with your Realtor and discuss the five must-have items you’re looking for in a home. When you walk into this meeting with that list already prepared, your agent will be much better equipped to point you in the right direction.4. Start looking at homes. After you’ve completed the first three steps, it’s time to get out there and start checking out your options. Your agent will be happy to take you on a showing of each property, but it’s also a good idea to do some research on your own beforehand. You may find that after driving by a certain home, you’re no longer interested in it. After this, you and your agent will tour between three and five homes to see if any are a good fit. Seeing any more than this at one time can cause the options to bleed together in your mind.“Don’t hire the first Realtor you see on a yard sign.”5. Write up an offer. Once you’ve found the right home, you and your agent will draft an offer. The seller will more than likely counter it, but your agent should be more than capable of navigating through the negotiation process.6. Provide an earnest money deposit. Assuming your offer was accepted and you’ve gone under contract, the next step is to submit an earnest money deposit. This deposit shows the seller that you are serious about the purchase. Better yet, the money will later be applied toward your down payment if the deal goes through as planned.7. Order an inspection. Home inspections are designed to identify any structural, mechanical, or safety issues in the property. The buyer can then request repairs based on the findings.8. Order an appraisal. While home inspections are meant to assess a home’s condition, an appraisal is meant to assess its value. Verifying what the home is worth with a professional appraiser is crucial, especially if you’re using a loan.9. Wait for the underwriter’s “clear to close.” Assuming everything goes as planned, the underwriter will approve the buyer to proceed to closing. Then, after you’ve signed a few dozen papers, the home is yours.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Today we’ll be looking at six great improvements you can make to your home:1. Kitchen. Buyers tend to focus a lot on a home’s kitchen, so this is a good place to make improvements. We’re seeing a lot of solid-surface countertops made of quartz, granite, or silestone. Stainless steel appliances are pretty much the norm now in modern kitchens (as a bonus, it never seems to go out of style). White cabinets are making a comeback as well, while we’re seeing darker-colored styles on their way out.2. Bathrooms. Updated vanities with solid-surface countertops are a good way to improve a bathroom. Higher-end homes often include heated floors, but there are kits you can use to install heated floors in your own home.3. Flooring. We’re seeing growing popularity in placing engineered hardwood floors on main levels. People seem to be moving away from tile and carpet in certain living areas, though carpet is still popular in bedrooms and some family rooms.4. Light and plumbing fixtures. It’s a good idea to move away from brass—we’re currently seeing brushed nickel and oil-rubbed bronze fixtures as the most popular options.5. Paint. Go for lighter beige or gray tones when you decide to update walls with a fresh coat of paint. It’s okay to have an accent wall or two, especially if you’re trying to sell, but don’t go overboard!6. Trending styles. These have to do primarily with popular floor plans we’re seeing, but keep in mind that these changes entail some major remodeling. We see main-level living spaces and homes without formal dining rooms.

There are many different kinds of loans you can qualify for, including:• Conventional loans, which have down payment options from 3.5% to 25%.• FHA loans, which are government-backed loans that require 3.5% down.• VA loans, which require no down payment but do require the buyer to have military service.• USDA loans, which also don’t require down payments, but can only be used in certain locations.The first thing you want to do if you’re trying to buy a home is reach out to a reputable local lender. If you don’t know one, we can help. We work with some of the top lenders in Colorado Springs.Next, you’ll need to determine whether you want a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate mortgage. In my opinion, a fixed rate is usually better because there are no surprises. You will always know what your payment will be. An adjustable rate is risky and can end up leaving you underwater.“ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES ARE PRETTY RISKY.”Then you’ll have to determine the length of your mortgage. You can do a 15-year, a 30-year, or in some cases, a 20-year term.Once you’ve decided what loan and terms are right for you, it’s time to fill out a loan application. It will ask you about your monthly income, expenses, account information, and all things financial. A credit score of 640 or above is usually good enough to qualify for any of the above loans.Finally, you will need to consider the fees, the closing costs, and the interest rates to determine what decision is best.If you have any questions for us in the meantime or would like us to connect you with a reputable local lender, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today.

Here are some of the pros and cons of doing so:Pros:  You can sell the home quickly in a specific time period.  A bidding war can lead to a higher sales price.  The home is usually sold as is, so you won’t have to worry about making any repairs to it.Cons:  You might not meet your reserve price (the price you set that’s the lowest you’re willing to sell the home for) if there’s not enough pre-marketing activity. I definitely recommend setting a reserve price, otherwise, your home might end up selling for $1.  You may have additional commissions, costs, fees, and expenses. Most real estate agents aren’t auctioneers, so you’ll have to pay for those additional services.  Many retail buyers don’t like the auction process—they have to pay additional fees as well.Home auctions are typically used by sellers whose homes aren’t selling quickly enough in a slower market, so since we’re in a really fast market, it may not apply to current conditions. Banks also tend to use auctions to sell homes that are in a state of disrepair.“HOME AUCTIONS ARE TYPICALLY USED BY SELLERS WHOSE HOMES AREN’T SELLING QUICKLY ENOUGH IN A SLOWER MARKET.”You have the choice of either auctioning your home through the public trustee’s auction at the steps of the courthouse or through a private auction company. My team has experience with both, so if you’d like more information about them or you have more questions about the auction process, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.As always, if you have any other questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, feel free to call or email me. My team and I would love to help you.",

Search all homes for saleHow much do you pay your real estate agent to sell your home? The truth may surprise you.I want to start by saying that commission fees are negotiable. There is no standard, set rate. If any agent is trying to tell you that there is a fixed rate, this is untrue. Every agent can charge whatever they choose.However, there is a traditional norm of 6%. This amount is usually split between the buyer’s agent and the selling agent.While commissions are not fixed, you do get what you pay for. A recently licensed real estate agent will come out and probably charge 6%, but are they going to have a marketing plan and budget?“WHAT IS CHEAP ISN’T GOOD AND WHAT IS GOOD ISN’T CHEAP.”To learn more about choosing the right agent, you can watch my other video here. In the meantime, you need to make sure that you pick the right agent that is going to have a budget to work with. If they are charging the standard rate, what are you getting for it?My team and I have a flexible fee structure where you choose the commission that you want to pay. Just remember, you get what you pay for. A friend of mine once said, “What is cheap isn’t good and what is good isn’t cheap.”If you have any specific questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me.

Get a free home value reportBuying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleWhether you’re preparing to list or simply want to keep your property up to date, there are a number of home improvement projects I recommend.“SOMETIMES THE SIMPLEST CHANGES MAKE THE GREATEST IMPACT.”1. Make kitchen updates. Solid-surface countertops, stainless steel appliances, and white cabinets are all great choices that never go out of style. Including these features in your own kitchen can really make the room shine.2. Make bathroom updates. Solid-surface countertops are also popular in bathrooms. One popular bathroom update in higher-end homes is the inclusion of heated floors.3. Update the flooring. Carpet is still popular in bedrooms and family rooms, but hardwood flooring is the way to go in kitchens, dining rooms, hallways, and more.4. Update the lighting and plumbing fixtures. Brass is no longer a sought-after finish for these home features. Instead, opt for brushed nickel or oil-rubbed bronze.5. Add fresh paint. Light, neutral colors such as beige are a good go-to choice these days. Greys are also very popular. Sometimes the simplest changes make the greatest impact.6. Pay attention to current trends. Open floor plans are something many buyers look for in a home. Also, outdoor living areas have become more highly sought-after. Formal dining rooms, on the other hand, seem to be falling out of favor.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can help you meet your real estate goals, feel free to give my team and me a call or send us an email.

It all began at a birthday party he was attending. Someone was attempting to fill up balloons but was struggling to do so.When Marc made a suggestion about his technique, the person just decided to put Marc in charge instead. It was at that party when Marc learned about turning these balloons into shapes. All of a sudden, he was changing balloons into cats, dogs, cars, and more.Marc is someone we’ve used at our own client events for years, and our team can tell you first-hand that he is a truly remarkable artist.In the spring, Marc often works at school dances, graduations, and other events. “Balloons aren’t just for kids,” Marc says.“OUR TEAM HAS WORKED WITH MARC FOR YEARS AND WE CAN TELL YOU THAT HE IS TRULY AN ARTIST.”Of course, Marc’s talent has caught a lot of local attention, meaning he’s always booked out far in advance.

        "content": "There are a few key differences in buying a home in Colorado versus buying a home in other states.Selling your Colorado home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleWhy is buying a home in Colorado different than buying a home in other states? There are a few key reasons.First, property taxes are paid in arrears, which means you pay for the previous year’s taxes. When you move in, you don’t pay taxes until April 15 of the next year.Next, sellers offer title insurance instead of a chain of title, which is more common in states on the East Coast.We also don’t use closing attorneys to close a transaction. Transactions are closed with other real estate agents through local title companies instead.Also, both parties attend the closing at the same time at the same location.The state contract to buy and sell real estate is also written slightly in the buyer’s favor here, so keep that in mind when you enter a real estate transaction and make sure you protect yourself whether you’re a buyer or a seller.“IT’S WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE A RADON INSPECTION IN COLORADO.”Colorado also has higher levels of radon, so when you have a home inspection performed, it’s worth the extra money to have the radon levels tested.Finally, there are certain intricacies involved when it comes to buying land that you need to be aware of.If you have any questions about any of these specificities or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Get a free home value reportBuying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleIf you think you don’t need an agent to buy a home, think again. Here’s what a real estate agent actually does to help you throughout the home buying process:1. An agent will help you determine what your needs and wants are before you even start looking at homes, which is very important in this fast-moving market.2. The agent will help obtain financing and a pre-approval from a good local lender that can get you to the closing table.3. Your agent will help you navigate through all the paperwork and regulations. In Colorado, the contract is over 16 pages long. That does not include the additional 15 to 20 pages of required disclosures.4. An agent will negotiate on your behalf and in your best interests. If you don’t work with a Realtor, there is no neutral third party to help you through the process. You will be emotionally tied to the property, and the other agent and the seller will be able to read that. As a result, you won’t have any leverage during negotiations.5. Your agent can provide valuable information about the neighborhood and the area. They will let you know about abandoned underground mines, areas with bad soil, and other details that local agents know that you may not, especially if you are from out of town.“WE WILL COORDINATE EVERYTHING IN THE TRANSACTION FOR YOU, FROM A TO Z.”Overall, your real estate agent has valuable experience that can help you throughout the entire transaction.
