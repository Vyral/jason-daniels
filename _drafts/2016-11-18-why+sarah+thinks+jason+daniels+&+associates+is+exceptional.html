I'll say that Jason and his team are exceptional, and I don't use that word lightly because I've sold two houses with Jason and there's a reason I came back to working with him. Not only did our house sell fast, it sold for the right price, we never had to reduce price, we never had to go up in price. I'd sold houses with other Realtors before so I had an idea of what was supposed to happen but what I was really impressed with, with Jason is that his negotiating skills are excellent and I'd never had any Realtor that I'd worked with before, I'm military, I've moved many times, bought and sold several houses, and no one has ever really taken the initiative to negotiate for things I didn't ask for. I really felt like I walked out with the best deal I possibly could have had. Jason Daniels, you definitely want him on your team!"</span></span></i><br /><br /><br />
