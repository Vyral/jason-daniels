Pent-up buyer demand is primed to explode; even with virtual tours during quarantine, we were seeing multiple-offer scenarios left and right. Six months’ worth or more of inventory is considered a buyer’s market, while anything under six months is a seller’s market—**we’re still firmly in a seller’s market**.
